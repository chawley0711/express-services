  "description": "Build a website for a service provider (plumber, electrician, computer repair, etc.). Feel free to invent a service that doesn't currently exist. Please keep it PG (I wouldn't say it if it hadn't been a problem in the past).\r Here are specs for the finished website:\r   -Contains a title page, service listings page, and an order page.\r   -Use Express and Pug for templates and routing\r   -Add Cool CSS transitions on pages (http://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_transitions.asp)\r   -Minimum eight service items for each category with item name, description, price, and image (can use content from the internet)\r   -Load the service items, their image names, prices, and the descriptions from a JSON file on the back-end (https://www.codementor.io/nodejs/tutorial/how-to-use-json-files-in-node-js)\r   -Display the service items using an 'each' in Pug (https://pugjs.org/language/iteration.html)\r   -The order page should be a form that requires name, address, phone, and has a checkboxes for the services desired\r   -When the order form has been submitted, have the information be saved to a text file on the server using 'fs'. (http://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/dacca2/node-js-in-action-create-simple-text-file-in-node-js-using/)\r   -Professionally designed pages (look at other service websites for inspiration)\r   -Nothing should break or look terrible if I change the window size, although mobile sizes are not required\r   -No libraries or modules except FS, Express, and Pug\r   -All code must be original and from this class\r Additional Resources:\r https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html\r  - Since we have only scratched the surface in Pug, you may want to brush up on all the cool things it can do",
